1. What is BMP2TEX
BMP2TEX is a small utility to convert a bitmap of any dimension but with a
single bit plane (2 colors) to a LaTeX readable file.

2. Syntax:
  BMP2TEX <bitmap> <out>

Where <bitmap> is the name of the bitmap file and <out> is the name of the
LaTeX file to create.

3. Bitmap formats
At this moment BMP2TEX can only read bitmap files in Windows3 or OS/2 2.xx
format with a single bit plane, not compressed.
That means you must convert other type of images to this format before trying
to convert them in LaTeX format, using the right utility (something like
PMJPEG for OS/2 o PaintShop for Windows).

4. How to use a LaTeX image file
You can import any image created with BMP2TEX, inserting the following
statement in your .TEX file:

        {\unitlength=1pt \input{ <pic> }}

where instead of <pic> you must insert the name of the picture file.
To resize the image you have to change the \unitlength definition, for example
if you need a bigger image try to use 2pt, or if you need a smaller image
try 0.5pt.
